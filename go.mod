	// `libp2p/zeroconf` is a fork of `grandcat/zeroconf`, which we previously used.
	// This fork includes some stability improvements and bug fixes that are absent
	// in the grandcat version. However, it is libp2p's internal maintenance fork,
	// which while being public, does not accept community contributions.
	// Both projects are dormant at the moment, but we might want to re-evaluate this
	// dependency choice as these projects evolve in the future.
